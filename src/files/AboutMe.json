    "aboutMe": [
        "I am a junior Front-end developer. Every day I develop my own projects or study the possibilities of the language. What I don't know, I will find, what I won't find, I will tactfully ask my colleagues. I know how to work in a team and I want to develop professionally. I am looking for a job to start my career in IT."
